This is a fork/continuation of the zmbkpose Zimbra hot backup script by Rubens Alonso Filho.

See:
http://www.kyapanel.com/wiki/doku.php?id=zimbra:zmbkpose
http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/HOT_Backup_and_HOT_Restore

I set it up on github for different reasons:

 * To make is easy for me to sync it to my different Zimbra instances
 * To make collaboration easier. Contributions are welcome.
 * The plan is to replace the incremental part Rubens started with
   rsnapshot. (http://www.rsnapshot.org/). So this is a fork.
